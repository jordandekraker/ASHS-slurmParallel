		ashs_train: generate a new training set for ASHS segmentation
		usage:
		  ashs_train [options]
		required options:
		  -D file           Input data file. See below.
		  -L file           Label description file. See below.
		  -w path           Working/output directory
		optional:
		  -d                Enable debugging
		  -h                Print help
		  -s integer        Run only one stage (see below); also accepts range (e.g. -s 1-3)
		  -r file           Apply heuristic rules (see below) to segmentations produced by ASHS.
		  -x file           Outer cross-validation loop specification file (see below)
		  -N                No overriding of ANTS/FLIRT results. If a result from an earlier run
		                    exists, don't run ANTS/FLIRT again
		  -Q                Use Sun Grid Engine (SGE) to schedule sub-tasks in each stage. By default,
		                    the whole ashs_train job runs in a single process. If you are on a cluster 
		                    that has SGE, you should really use this flag
		  -q OPTS           Pass in additional options to SGE's qsub. Also enables -Q option above.
		  -G                Use SLURM (graham) to submit the jobs (requires neuroglia-helpers)
		  -z script         Provide a path to an executable script that will be used to retrieve SGE or
		                    GNU parallel options for different stages of ASHS. Takes precendence over -q
		  -P                Use GNU parallel to run on multiple cores on the local machine. You need to
		                    have GNU parallel installed.
		  -C file           Configuration file. If not passed, uses $ASHS_ROOT/bin/ashs_config.sh
		  -m file           Specify transforms between T1 and T2 scans for some atlases. This is useful when
		                    registration between the T1 and T2 images fails during training. See "transform
		                    specification file" below.
		  -S integer        Specify stage(s) for cross-validation. Only useful if you need to rerun the 
		                    cross-validation and want to run just a subset of stages. For developers mostly.
		  -V                Display version information and exit

		stages:
		  1                 Initialize atlas directory
		  2                 Build population-specific template
		  3                 Resample each atlas to template space
		  4                 Perform n^2 registration between all atlases
		  5                 Train AdaBoost method
		  6                 Organize final directory
		  7                 Cross-validation      

		data file:
		  The datafile is a comma-separated file listing, with rows corresponding to input images
		  For each image, the following columns are included:
		  
		    ID T1_MRI TSE_MRI SEG_LEFT SEG_RIGHT

		label description file:
		  This file is used to define the labels in the segmentation protocol. It is possible to 
		  have the same strugure (e.g., CA1) to have the same label on the left and on the right,
		  or to have then have separate labels. ASHS will handle it either way. The label file is
		  in the ITK-SNAP label format, i.e., a format of the file obtained by running ITK-SNAP
		  and selecting from the menu "Segmentation->Save Label Descriptions". Each line in the file
		  consists of seven numbers separated by whitespace, followed by a string in quotation marks.
		
		      0     0    0    0        0  0  0    "Clear Label"
		      1   255    0    0        1  1  1    "CA1"
		      2     0  255    0        1  1  1    "CA2"
		
		  The entries are: (1) the index of the label; (2-4) the R/G/B components of the color 
		  corresponding to the label (used to generate some figures in ASHS); (5-7) affect the
		  visibility of the label in SNAP; set them to 0 0 0 for the background and 1 1 1 for the
		  foreground labels. The name of the label is in quotation marks. The file can also include
		  comments (lines that start with a # character). 
		  
		data requirements:
		  The ASHS_TSE image slice direction should be z. In other words, the dimension
		  of ASHS_TSE image should be 400x400x30 or something like that, not 400x30x400
		
		cross-validation file (-x option):
		  This file specifies what kind of a cross-validation experiment to perform to test the
		  segmentation performance across the atlases. Each row corresponds to one experiment.
		  Each column lists the IDS of the test subjects for that experiment (i.e., the subjects
		  left out from atlas building). Cross-validation is optional.
		
		heuristic rules (-r option):
		  Rules can be specified to restrict certain labels in the segmentation to certain slices.
		  This is needed when the underlying segmentation protocol covers a portion of the slices
		  in the hippocampus, and the automatic method needs to be consistent with that protocol.
		  See the Yushkevich et al., 2010 Neuroimage paper for the heuristic rules applied there.
		  The format of the heuristic file can be found in the help for the subfield_slice_rules
		  program.
		  
		transform specification file (-m option):
		  The file consists of lines in the format:
		
		    ID TRANSFORM FORCE
		
		  where ID matches the IDs in the manifest, TRANSFORM is a linear transform between
		  the T2 image and the T1 image (Convert3D/ITK-SNAP format) and FORCE is a flag with
		  0 meaning that the transform should be used as the starting point for automatic
		  T2/T1 registration and 1 meaning that the TRANSFORM should be used in place of 
		  automatic T2/T1 registration. Specify this only for subjects where automatic T2/T1
		  registration fails.
		
		SGE Options:
		  You can have detailed control over SGE options by passing a custom shell script to the -z
		  option. ASHS will call this shell script with the working directory as the first parameter
		  and stage as the second parameter. The script should print to stdout the SGE (qsub) options
		  that should be used for this stage. This allows you to allocate resources for each stage.
